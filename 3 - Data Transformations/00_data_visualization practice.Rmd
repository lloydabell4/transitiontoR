#Set up Code

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
surveys_complete <- read_csv("data/surveys_complete.csv")
```

For this exercise, I'd like for you to explore a mammals dataset collected by: Ernest, Morgan; Brown, James; Valone, Thomas; White, Ethan P. (2015): Portal Project Teaching Database. figshare. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459.v5 

Are there any distinctive species (identified by hindfoot length and weight) that decrease in number over time?
```{r}


```
